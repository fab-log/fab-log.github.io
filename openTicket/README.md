## openTicket

This app provides a simple ticket management that let's you create new tickets, add entries, assign colors, due dates, and priority. In the default mode tickets are displayed in a table like structure offering filtering and sorting options. The optional 'bubble' appearance enables a more intuitive style automatically sorting the tickets by priority and due date.
Tickets and entries can be searched by keywords.
The app provides a responsive design working well on wide screens and on mobile devices. Toggling dark and light mode is possible, too.
