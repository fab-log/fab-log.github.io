    <ul>
        <li>Internet access</li>
        <li>Browser</li>

    <ol>
        <li>In the file manager of your operating system create a folder and name it whatever you like</li>
        <li>Paste an image of yourself to that folder and note its exact name including the extension (e.g. <i>mypic.png</i>)</li>
        <li>Launch the code editor and create a new text file. Save it to the folder you just created naming it <i>index.html</i></li>
        <li>Write the following lines of code to the new text file:<br>
            <img src="code-snippet.png"><br>
            Replace <i>YourName</i> by your name.
            </li>
        <li>Within your browser navigate to github.com and opt for sign up or sign in if you already have an account.</li>
        <li>Once logged in you will see a <i>new</i> button next to the top repositories. Click it.</li>
        <li>In the form showing up now fill the field for <i>Repository</i> name with a name as follows:<br>'yourname.github.io' (whereas yourname should be replaced by a name of your choice)</li>
        <li>In the line below you can add a description of the project you are planning to commit.</li>
        <li>Confirm by clicking <i>create</i></li>
        <li>In the next step in the <i>quick setup</i> section you'll see a link saying <i>uploading an existing file</i>. Click that.</li>
        <li>Now, you can either drag and drop the two files (png and html) to the designated area or upload them by clicking <i>choose your files</i> and then selecting the two files from your file manager</li>
        <li>To complete this step you need to hit <i>commit changes</i></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Switch to your browser and type 'yourname.github.io' to the address bar. If everything went as it should you will now see your irst page on github.</p>
