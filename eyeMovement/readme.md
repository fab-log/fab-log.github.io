## Eye movement

This little animation shows a pair of eyes looking at you. You can control the eye movement by simply moving the mouse over the screen.

Eye movement is an exercise from the MIT xPRO full stack developer course demonstrating the interaction of Javascript and the DOM.

For the time being there are no further improvements planned. Yet, in the future possible features could be further parts of a face or additional effects like squinting.

Feel free to share, download or reuse the code without any restrictions.
