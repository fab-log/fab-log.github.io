## Pacmen

This game lets you create pacmen and make them move across the screen. Once they touck the lateral borders they flip and look in the corresponding direction.

For the time being there are no further features planned but in the future additional effects on collisions or side impacts as well as different styles and sizes could be added.

Feel free to use, download, and modify the code with no restrictions.
