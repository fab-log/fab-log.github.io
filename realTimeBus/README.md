## Real time bus tracker

In this animation you can find all the bus stops to a given destination on a map. A bus icon simulates the route of the bus and names the single stops.

At the moment there is only one predefined route available. In future versions there might be a user input interface so you can choose start and destination by yourself.

Feel free to share, download or reuse the code without any restrictions.
